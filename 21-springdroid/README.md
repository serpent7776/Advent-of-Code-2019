# AoC #21

## Solution in awk

### Part 1

Run `./gen.sh`.

This expects a file called `input` to contain your puzzle input.

This is doing case by case analysis on what bool expression to use and them combine them all using simplogic.dev.

### Part 2

Run `./gen2.sh`.

This expects a file called `input` to contain your puzzle input.

This is doing the same thing as part 1. This time though simplogic doesn't give the simple enough resulting expression. I used wolframalpha instead.
