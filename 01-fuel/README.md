# AoC #1

## Solution in awk

Just run `./fuel1.sh` or `./fuel2.sh` in your terminal. This expects `input` file to exist in your current directory.

Both scripts are fairly simple. They process standard input line by line and print result when done.
The second one uses recursive function that could blow up for larger fuel values, but worked fine for input given.
